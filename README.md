# Sentiment Analysis â€“ Abusive Text Detection

# Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model focused on detecting abusive language in text. The model is trained on labeled data and achieves high accuracy in identifying toxic, offensive, and harmful content.

# Features
Text Classification: Detects abusive and non-abusive text.
Machine Learning Model: Uses NLP techniques for feature extraction and classification.
High Accuracy: Optimized model for reliable predictions.
Jupyter Notebook: Includes code for training, evaluation, and testing.

# Tech Stack
Python
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
Scikit-learn (for model training)
NLTK / SpaCy (for text preprocessing)
Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)

# Usage
Modify the dataset in data/ folder (if needed).
Update model hyperparameters in the notebook.
Test custom text inputs for abusive content detection.

# Results
Achieves high accuracy in detecting abusive language.
Model evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) are available in the notebook.

# Contributing
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests for improvements.
